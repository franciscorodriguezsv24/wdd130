        <p class="testing">I am a curious and passionate person who is always looking for new knowledge and experiences. I love
            programming, not just as a skill but as a way to create and solve problems in an innovative way. I enjoy
            exploring new places, as each one offers a different perspective and an opportunity to discover something
            unique. I'm also a video game enthusiast, where I find a space for strategy, creativity, and fun. For me,
            every day is an opportunity to grow, discover, and keep doing what I love. </p>
